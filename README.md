# My Portfolio

This is my fifth attempt at making a portfolio site. This time, I wanted something that felt a bit more personal, and less sterile than my last one. I also wanted to challenge myself and push my limits of what I can create. Fancy animations, animated grainy gradient background and glass-like materials are all such things.

It's now (mostly) finished, and published on my main domain.
