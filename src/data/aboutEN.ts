	## Education
	I have graduated from the M.Sc. program in Interaction and Design at UmeÃ¥ University. The program covers everything from basic courses in programming and mathematics to psychology and UI/UX. The main reason I chose this program was that I simply couldn't choose between the human and the technical aspects. I found both parts super interesting â€” and still do!

	![](../img/about/UX_EN.svg "The program is broad and 'makes you an expert in the interaction between humans and machines'.")[centercaption]

	As part of my studies, but also in my own time, I have worked with various technologies and programming languages. I've experimented with everything from imperative programming in C, object-oriented programming in Java, to functional programming in Haskell.

	Thus far, the area I've chosen to focus on is web and frontend development. In that area, I would say I'm most skilled, but I'd be eager to try other things too!

	## What else?
	In my spare time, I mostly hang out with my friends. I sometimes play a bit of Civilization VI or other computer games. I also spend some time in the Swedish mountains with my family, who live there. While there, I go skiing and hiking lots!
